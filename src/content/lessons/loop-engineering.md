## Key takeaway

Autonomous loops must be designed with explicit termination conditions, robust state management, and clear escalation paths to prevent runaway execution and budget exhaustion.

## Mental model or small diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Plan
    Plan --> Execute
    Execute --> Evaluate
    Evaluate --> Plan : Failure
    Evaluate --> [*] : Success
    Evaluate --> Escalate : Max Iterations Reached
```

## When to use and when not to use

**When to use:**

- Self-Correcting Workflows (e.g., agents writing and debugging code).
- Open-Ended Research tasks requiring continuous information gathering.
- Multi-Agent Orchestration.

**When not to use:**

- Linear, Predictable Tasks like simple data extraction. Use a DAG or pipeline instead.
- Strict Budget Constraints where you cannot risk an agent looping unnecessarily.

## Method or procedure

1. **Define Convergence:** Establish how the agent measures progress toward its goal.
2. **Set Termination Rules:** Enforce max iterations, timeout limits, or budget caps.
3. **Build Recovery Logic:** Detect when the agent repeats the exact same action and force a new approach or pause.
4. **Context Pruning:** Implement summarization steps to compress previous iterations so the context window doesn't overflow.

## Worked example

**Process:**

```python
max_iterations = 5
iteration = 0
passed = False
previous_errors = []

while iteration < max_iterations and not passed:
    code = agent.generate_code(prompt, previous_errors)
    test_results = environment.run_tests(code)
    
    if test_results.is_success:
        passed = True
        break
        
    if agent.is_stuck_in_repetition(test_results, previous_errors):
        agent.escalate_to_human("Stuck in a loop. Need assistance.")
        break
        
    previous_errors.append(test_results.error_messages)
    iteration += 1
```

## Failure modes and mitigations

- **Infinite Loops (Hallucination Traps):** The agent tries the same incorrect solution endlessly. *Mitigation: Track action history and break if the similarity of consecutive actions is too high.*
- **Context Collapse:** The loop runs so long the prompt history exceeds the LLM limit. *Mitigation: Summarize past iterations every N steps.*

## Evaluation checklist or rubric

- [ ] **Graceful Termination:** Does the loop stop when max iterations are hit?
- [ ] **Repetition Awareness:** Does the agent recognize and recover from repeated failures?
- [ ] **Escalation Triggers:** Does the agent ask for human help when genuinely stuck?

## Safety, privacy, and cost notes

- **Cost:** Loops are extremely dangerous for budgets. Always set a hard limit on API calls or token spend per session.

## Practice task

Design a state machine for an agent whose goal is to scrape a website, extract pricing data, and format it. Define the states, the success condition, and at least two failure states that trigger an escalation to a human.

### Operational Summary

To ensure sustained performance and avoid regressions in the production environment, teams should schedule regular audits of these configurations. It is crucial to review alerting thresholds and adapt them as traffic patterns evolve or new failure modes are discovered. The operational lifecycle of these AI systems demands continuous feedback loops between the evaluation metrics and the engineering teams responsible for infrastructure. Ultimately, these advanced controls are what separate a fragile prototype from a resilient, enterprise-grade AI architecture.
